**Many minor bugs were present. A db folder is required to create the todos.db and add table in it which was missing. Minor fixes were required in db.run query, an extra comma was present. Nodemon was used but was not present in package.json. The functionality of put request was wrong as the value of completed was getting set at title and that of title was setting at completed. Deployed on render.**
